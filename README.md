[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evan-007/pair-program.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evan-007/pair-program)

demo: <a href='http://tranquil-tor-7118.herokuapp.com'>http://tranquil-tor-7118.herokuapp.com</a>. Demo
loads super slow, refresh page if initial load looks weird.

`clone` and `bundle install && rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`

##Dev Builds

The dev app has 3 parts: rails, redis and gulp. Run rails with `rails s`, angular with `cd client && gulp`.
Redis is required by SideKiq and runs via `config/initializers/redis.rb`.

Install redis: `brew install redis`.

Requires a restart of `rails server` for any code changes to take effect.

Rails api lives in the rails app as usual, the angular app is in `client`.
`cd client && bower install && npm install` to install dependencies for the
front end. In `client`, run unit tests with `karma start`.

##Secrets!
`cp environment_variables.yml.example environment_variables.yml` and update
with real info for mailer. If deploying to heroku, this is bypassed and set via `heroku config`.

##Testing

Rspec needs and redis running, as does protractor.

Todo: see `gulp e2e-test` task for progress.

##Deployment

Deploy to heroku with `heroku create` `git push heroku master`. Be sure that
`application_controller` has  `skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token
` commented out in production and `protect_from_forgery with: :null_session` is
set. Also set the heroku domain in `config/app_config.yml` to allow CORS.

todo: change `app_config.yml` to use an env variable for `client/origin`

If deploy does not show `index.html` and returns `status 404`, set
`config.serve_static_assets = true` in `production.rb` (Rails 4 default is `false`).

Don't forget `heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed` after deploying.
