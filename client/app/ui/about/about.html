      <a ui-sref='signup'>Signup</a> for an account
      and you'll be able to submit <a ui-sref='postings'>Posts</a> which are
      mini-proposals telling people what you want to work on. Anyone who's interested

      You can also look around in the <a href="">Friend Finder</a> for people
      who work on the same kind of stuff. You'll have to send them a friend request,
      but after you'll be able to message each other and figure out what you wanna work on.
